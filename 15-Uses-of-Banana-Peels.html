          <p>Banana is one of the most popular fruit, and it is perfectly sliced on a bowl of cereal, smoothie, or blended, or simply enjoyed by itself as an afternoon snack. The fruit even comes with its handy packaging, a peel that also serves as a mess-free way to hold it. When you‚Äôre finished, just throw away the peel like any other wrapper. Should you, however?</p>
          <p>Have you ever thought about where all of those discarded peels end up? Yes, alongside the rest of the trash at the landfill, they rot and emit methane gas.</p>
          <p>Those peels don‚Äôt have to end up in the trash; there are various uses for banana peels.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Check out these 15 inventive ways to reuse banana peels instead of tossing them in the trash.
          </p>
          <h3>Natural fly trap</h3>
          <p>Spring and summer are here, which is the ideal season for garden parties. Except for one minor annoyance, we all adore them. You can make a trap out of natural ingredients to catch them. You‚Äôll only need a large yogurt cup, banana skin, a hammer, and a nail. With the hammer and nail, make holes in the bottom of the yogurt cup, place the banana inside, turn it over, and place it near the food you‚Äôre trying to protect. The sweet smell in the holes will attract flies, but there is no way out of the yogurt cup.</p>
          <h3>Remove the aphids</h3>
          <p>If pests appear in the garden, it is best to get rid of them as soon as possible and as naturally as possible. Make a 2.5-centimeter-deep hole under the plants and insert 2-3 banana peels. Aphids and ants will detect the banana‚Äôs potassium content and eat it instead of the plants. You can repeat the process every other week to ensure that your plants remain safe.</p>
          <h3>Relieves itching from insect bites</h3>
          <p>With the arrival of warm weather, various bugs, insects, and mosquitoes multiply. If you want to naturally relieve the sting of these insects, banana peel can help by rubbing it on the infected area.</p>
          <h3>Bake a cake</h3>
          <p>Do you want to make a quick and delicious cake, but you‚Äôve already used up all of your bananas? Not a problem! Make a cake out of the peel. Simply blend the banana peels and 1/2 cup of water in a blender until you have an aromatic, smooth, dark brown mush.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">In a bowl, whisk the sugar, egg yolks, and butter until smooth. Stir in the banana skin puree, baking powder, and flour until well mixed. Then, gently fold the egg whites into the mixture before pouring it all into a cake pan and baking for 45 minutes ‚Äì or until the cake passes the toothpick test.
          </p>
          <h3>Polish Your Shoes</h3>
          <p>Forget about smearing your shoes with shoe polish. All you need to do is rub the inside of the peel against your shoes and watch the scuffs vanish into thin air. With a soft cloth, buff and wipe away any residue, and your kicks will be as good as new. A slightly underripe banana works best.</p>
          <h3>Moisturize Your Feet</h3>
          <p>Banana peels are high in amino acids and vitamins A, B, C, and E, which are all beneficial to dry, itchy skin. Rub the peel on your soles and any other dry areas to give your cracked heels and tired toes a boost. Simply rinse away any remaining goop and repeat for a few days. In no time, they‚Äôll be silky-smooth. You can now remove that pricey foot cream from your Amazon shopping cart.</p>
          <h3>Treat Acne</h3>
          <p>What makes it so effective? Banana peels are naturally high in lectin and zinc, both of which have antibacterial properties that can aid problem spots heal faster and even prevent new ones from appearing. After cleansing, gently rub the inside of a slightly overripe banana peel onto the affected areas. Rub the peel until it becomes brown and slimy, then leave it on your skin for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing. Apply the peel a few times per day for seven days to see results. Just be careful not to scrub too hard or too roughly, as this can irritate your skin even more.</p>

          <h3>Remove Warts</h3>
          <p>Banana peels can help with pain and inflammation relief (that includes psoriasis, bruises, and cuts). Some people claim it has helped them eliminate warts because the moisture-packed bananas soften the wart while the peel‚Äôs enzymes penetrate the bump to its root. Apply a small piece of banana peel inside out to the wart. Check that the peel and wart are touching. Remove the peel in the morning and replace it with a fresh piece every night. The wart should be gone in three weeks. Bananas that are green or slightly yellow work best on warts; the enzymes in the peel degrade as the banana ages.</p>
          <h3>Shine And Fertilize Plants</h3>
          <p>Photosynthesis can be hampered by dust, but a quick rub of its leaves with the banana peel can bring it back to life. Banana peels are also commonly used as fertilizer by many people. You can either cut up the peel, mix it in with your plant‚Äôs soil, bury the whole peel, or make ‚Äútea‚Äù with the peels. Simply fill a pitcher or glass of water with as many banana peels as possible and leave it out of direct sunlight for two or three days. Then, whenever your plants are thirsty, water them with a surprise boost of nutrients.</p>
          <h3>Remove Splinters</h3>
          <p>Some fragments are simple to remove. However, if you have a tearful child with a near-microscopic sliver of wood stuck deep in his hand, it can be a difficult task. Enter banana peels high in enzymes and coax the splinter to the surface of their skin for a painless pluck. Simply tape a piece of banana peel inside-out over the splinter for up to a half-hour, then remove and tweeze away.</p>
          <h3>Cook With Them</h3>
          <p>The secret to moist meat is banana peels. Simply place a ripe banana peel or two in the bottom of the roasting pan before cooking something tender and juicy, such as pot roast. Cover the meat with banana peels while it cooks if you‚Äôre making something like chicken breast or turkey that is prone to drying out in the oven. The peels will steam, which will aid in the moisture retention of the meat.</p>
          <h3>Add Them To Tea And Smoothies</h3>
          <p>Banana peels have a surprising number of edible applications. The only catch? You must first wash the outside of the banana as you would any other fruit with edible skin and then cut off the stem and nub on each side. Throw a peel in with the rest of the banana in your smoothie for extra nutrients, steep the whole banana in water to make tea, or boil and strain a few peels to make vitamin-packed banana peel juice to add to smoothies and other recipes.</p>
          <h3>Pain Reliever</h3>
          <p>If you prefer to use natural medicines, the banana peel will be beneficial to you. Simply place a banana peel directly on the painful area and leave it for 30 minutes. Alternatively, you can make a cream out of the banana peel and some kind of vegetable oil, which can also help with pain relief.</p>
          <h3>Facial mask</h3>
          <p>Simply rub the banana peel on your face for 15 minutes, then thoroughly wash your skin with water.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">For those with problematic skin, it is also worthwhile to make a banana or banana facial mask. Bananas contain vitamins that nourish the skin while also reducing inflammation.

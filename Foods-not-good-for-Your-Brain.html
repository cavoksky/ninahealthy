          <p>The brain is one of the most critical organs in the body, it regulates all of the other organs, and it has complete control all over them.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">If you want your brain to be as clear as possible, so eating well is important, It also slows cognitive deterioration and lowers the risk of dementia as you get older.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;">Here is a list of 15 foods you should know to keep a healthy brain:
          </p>
          <h3>Trans Fatty Acids</h3>
          <p>It‚Äôs important to note that not all fats are bad for you, but trans-fats have a particularly negative impact on the brain. They are naturally present in animal products such as meat and dairy, but the ones manufactured industrially, which are then injected into packaged foods, are the worst. They are commonly used in chips, crackers, margarine, store-bought baked goods, frozen and canned meals, and smooth drinks and are often referred to as hydrogenated oils.</p>
          <h3>Sugary Beverages</h3>
          <p>Sports drinks, sodas, fruit juice, and energy drinks are high in sugar and have little or no nutritional value. Regular consumption of such beverages can result in a variety of physical problems. Diabetes type 2, high blood pressure, cholesterol, and, yes, even brain-related diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and dementia are among them.</p>
          <h3>Refined carbohydrates</h3>
          <p>The term ‚Äúrefined carbohydrates‚Äù refers to goods made from refined grains. They don‚Äôt have to be sweet, but the refining process causes them to break down into sugar very easily once they enter your body. The processing process removes all of the original grain‚Äôs fiber. When you eat a meal high in processed carbs, the glycemic load rises dramatically, resulting in a blood sugar spike. It essentially causes the same issues that consuming straight sugars does.</p>
          <h3>Aspartame</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, substituting artificial sweeteners for sugar would not prevent the harm that sugar can cause. In reality, aspartame is even more harmful to your health. While its manufacturers will normally say that it is healthy, studies have shown that aspartame can cause cognitive and behavioral problems. Aspartame consumption can cause you to perform poorly on mental tests. You‚Äôre more likely to have a stroke and dementia if you consume aspartame.</p>
          <h3>Processed And Packaged foods</h3>
          <p>Processed foods have been discovered to be devoid of essential nutrients present in whole foods. Worse, these foods substitute sugar, fat, and salt for it. Unfortunately, since these foods are fast and easy, many people prefer them to slow cooked homemade meals. If you don‚Äôt want fat to accumulate around your vital organs, however, it‚Äôs best to prepare as many healthy whole foods as possible.</p>
          <h3>Alcohol</h3>
          <p>Given all of the bad choices people make when they‚Äôre drunk, this shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. Although a drink or two every now and then won‚Äôt harm you, long-term binge drinking is harmful to your brain‚Äôs health. When you make drinking a habit, your brain shrinks, and the alcohol will interfere with the neurotransmitters that allow your brain to communicate.</p>
          <h3>Cured Meats</h3>
          <p>Consumption of cured meats can cause mental fog. Bacon, prosciutto, bacon, capicola, and pastrami are only a few examples. When you consume foods high in protein and salt, the body has to use more water to flush out the nitrogen that naturally occurs in those foods. As a result, you may have less water in your body, which may impair your cognitive abilities and you will become dehydrated.</p>

          <h3>Mercury-rich fish</h3>
          <p>Fish is generally beneficial to one‚Äôs health. It is low in saturated fat while also containing beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. Vitamin B12, iron, magnesium, and zinc are also present. That may be true, but some fish do contain high levels of mercury, which can be extremely harmful to your brain.</p>
          <h3>Soy sauce</h3>
          <p>Soy sauce is commonly used to season foods like sushi, but did you know that only a tablespoon contains nearly 40% of the recommended daily salt intake? According to research, hypertension caused by consuming a lot of salt or even sodium-rich foods like soy sauce can cause blood flow to the brain to be limited, affecting your concentration, memory, and organizational skills.</p>
          <h3>Ribeye Steak</h3>
          <p>When it comes to steaks, many people like ribeye, but it is also the worst because of the amount of fat it contains. In a serving of 6 ounces, it contains up to 26 grams of the nutrient, as well as twelve grams of saturated fat. This is bad not only for your heart‚Äôs normal functioning, but also for your brain‚Äôs, since it can lead to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and impair your cognitive function.</p>
          <h3>Frozen pizza</h3>
          <p>Fattening foods are known to induce exhaustion, which may make the mind feel foggy. Frozen pizza is particularly bad for your brain‚Äôs health because it contains 24 grams of fat in just one serving. If you really want to eat a frozen pie or pizza, choose one with less fat, such as Peas of Mind Cheese, which has just five grams of fat, or Kashi Stone-Fired Thin Crust Pizza Mushroom Trio and Spinach, which has about nine grams of fat.</p>
          <h3>Ice cream</h3>
          <p>Many people would indulge in ice cream to stop the afternoon slump, but did you know that this actually does more harm than good? Ice cream is high in saturated fat, which clogs arteries, as well as sugar. According to research, these deteriorate your cognitive abilities as well as your verbal memory. Instead of ice cream, serve Greek yogurt with blueberries or strawberries.</p>
          <h3>Vegetable Oils</h3>
          <p>Vegetable oils would seem to be better than butter, but this is not the case. Omega-6 is abundant in soybean, sunflower, and canola oils, which causes inflammation in the brain. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and memory loss have been attributed to these. Although Omega-6 fatty acids are essential for the health of your bones, hair, and skin, it is better to use oils like olive oil, which contain healthier omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
          <h3>Fried Foods</h3>
          <p>Fries and donuts, in addition to being bad for your waistline and weight in general, can cause brain disorders. People who consume large quantities of fried food perform poorly on tests, have difficulty learning, and have reduced brain function. It is preferable to eat baked or grilled foods that are high in brain boosters.</p>
          <h3>Citrus and Diet Soda</h3>
          <p>Some countries have banned brominated vegetable oils. Small amounts are not inherently dangerous, but they are used in drinks like these and can accumulate in the body system, causing memory loss and nervous disorders. The sugars in these drinks will impair one‚Äôs memory and make it more difficult to concentrate at work.</p>
